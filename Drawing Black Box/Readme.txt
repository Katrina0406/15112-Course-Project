Project: Drawing Black Box - converting hand-drawn art to electronic art and recreating it.

Usage: In this project, the user can scan/upload a sketch and the program will extract its contours on a drawing board. The user can then modify the contours on this board and continue drawing based on the electronic contours. They will be able to save their work on their computers.

Run:
- Install openCV: 
 * MacOS: https://docs.opencv.org/master/d0/db2/tutorial_macos_install.html
 * Windows: https://docs.opencv.org/master/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html
 * Linux: https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html

- Open terminal on your computer (please run from terminal instead of in an editor since openCV doesn't work well in an editor).

- Run tp.py python file (in Project Folder)
 * Click 'Scan'/'Upload' to start or click 'Help' to see instructions
 * Note that the circles functioned for lines you draw, while the rectangle buttons mostly adjust the contours.
 * Also note that if you want to upload pics on your computer, you can put the pic within the Project folder and upload by typing in its name (e.g. sample.jpg)

- Shortcut:
 * Press'q' to quit the program; Press "ctrl x" to force the program quit.
 * Click 'Upload' and enter 'sample', then click ok, click 'Draw' to see the sample contour (You can also see the original image named 'sample.jpg' in the folder).
